Lila?Neutral "Lesson plans for next week. I have an assistant who usually helps me with them, but she only has ten paid hours a week, so she doesn't stay past that."
Lila?Neutral "The rest falls on me! Regardless of my hours."

* Let me know if I can help with that. Speaking of, I got some information on the speaker event Saturday.
    Lila?Smiling "Oh cool! "
     -> ReadyToSolve
* Head Start can always use more funding. Let me know if you want me to look into that in the future. Oh, also, do you have a moment to hear about the info I found?
    Lila?Neutral "Yeah! "
    -> ReadyToSolve

==ReadyToSolve==

* Amazing. I think that covers everything we talked about earlier, right? 
    Lila?Neutral "Yep! "

==BadSolution==
Lila?Neutral "That would work, but Iâ€™m not sure it covers enough that it would give me enough time to set up the rest of the event before the block party."

* Let me look again. I know I heard something else...
    -> PuzzleInterface
* Let me get back to you on that. I'll go check with Rashad again.
