         <string name="backstories_1">Morning in Bloomwood is my favorite time. I grew up here, and from my apartment’s window, I can hear everyone waking up around me. The neighborhood used to feel as alive as the people.\n\nIn the summer, folks fixed their cars outside my building and played music until the street lamps came on. There was always an end of summer block party, and always something to do. Now? Not so much.</string>
         <string name="backstories_2">Times have changed. People feel distant from each other. Developers built mixed use high rises, and new programs have come in bringing grants, funding, and new facilities. This was great, except the rents got higher and it felt like half the neighborhood was getting left behind. More and more of our old neighbors are moving out. More and more new faces are moving in, who aren’t as connected to the people already living here.</string>
         <string name="backstories_3">Not everyone in Bloomwood is getting a fair shake these days. Instead of talking to your neighbor, folks called in noise complaints. It feels like no one knows their neighbors anymore. We just keep to ourselves. I want to change that. Bloomwood was never the place where you ignored your neighbors. So I came up with a plan. A good one. As the Bloomwood Community Liaison to the city, I was able to secure a permit for an old school style block party to celebrate the reopening of our Community Center....</string>
         <string name="backstories_4">... I got us a bouncy house, food, even a health fair! Now I just have to convince some folks to help me work it. I know who to ask. I know how to ask them.  I’ve always been good at connecting people and helping everyone out. Maybe if I can connect everyone in the neighborhood, Bloomwood can see that what really makes a neighborhood is not the buildings, or the grants, or the businesses that rush in. It’s the people.</string>
         
         <string name="ending_1">I’ve been talking so much about Bloomwood Spirit and getting this block party ready.  Today as we blocked off streets and inflated the giant bounce house, I wondered if all my efforts to help did the job. People have bigger issues. Health, money, family, school...did we make enough time? Share enough resources?</string>
         <string name="ending_2">Our Block Party is a connection between the old Bloomwood and the new Bloomwood. The smells of food and the whirring of the cotton candy machine all brought back memories. But could this bring the people?</string>
         <string name="ending_3">Just as I began to worry, Mr. Calindas arrived to set up the Healthcare tent. He patted me on the back before he went to instruct volunteer nurses on how to work with the community. “Paz and Jessica are showing up soon! Don’t worry!”</string>
         <string name="ending_4">I still worried, but it wasn’t long before Lila waved to me as she and Trisha carried art supplies, mobbed by several children who were as excited to see her outside of class as they were to see her in class. “Yes, I bought the facepaint and temporary tattoos! You just have to let me set up!”</string>
         <string name="ending_5">Rashad parked the library van, and Octavia and Charles sprinted towards the cotton candy machine. “Ya’ll don’t eat too much of that,” he called out, knowing full well they would eat too much of it.</string>
         <string name="ending_6">The trickle of people became a warm inviting crowd of neighbors. Mrs. Lee, all smiles, brought her grandson Eddie, who I haven’t seen in forever. “Do you remember my grandson, Eddie? I’m very proud of him.” Eddie looked just as proud of her.</string>
         <string name="ending_7">Elisa and her family carried succulents, and a few of her friends from school had boxes filled with extras. “We have the perlite, and the rocks. Mini Bloomwood terrariums, these are gonna be so cute!”</string>
         <string name="ending_8">We spent the whole day laughing, playing, and celebrating. Mr. Calindas was right. I didn’t need to worry. As music filled the neighborhood and the bounce house shook, I looked at my neighbors. We needed this. I needed this. We could be here, because we all helped each other. Bloomwood spirit has never been about the buildings, or the grants, or the businesses that rush in.</string>
         <string name="ending_9">It’s always been the people.</string>
